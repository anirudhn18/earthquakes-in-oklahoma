Codes, files and documentation for the Earthquakes in Oklahoma project for Programming and Application Development course @ MSBA.

The goals of this project were three fold:

- Analyze earthquake activity in terms of frequency and intensity
- Explore possiblity of connections between these two seemingly independent elements
